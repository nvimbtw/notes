## üìñ About the Project
This repo holds my class notes, compiled into clean PDFs for easy sharing and studying. I use **Typst** (a modern typesetting tool that's like a blend of LaTeX precision and Markdown simplicity) to keep everything structured and beautiful.

### Folder Structure
Notes are organized by semester and class for logical navigation:
- **1.Semester/**: First-semester courses (e.g., `IVP/`, `PKV/`, `PRO-1/`, `ZP-1/`).
- **2.Semester/**: Second-semester courses (add yours here!).
- Each class folder (e.g., `ZP-1/`) is a self-contained "project":
  - **`ZP-1.typ`**: The main file‚Äîsets global attributes like page size, fonts, and imports all lessons.
  - Subfolders (e.g., `1_info/`, `2_uvod/`): One per lesson/topic, with individual `.typ` files (e.g., `info.typ`).
  - **`ZP-1.pdf`**: The compiled full-class PDF (or export subsections for smaller files).

This setup lets me:
- Generate one big PDF per class for comprehensive reviews.
- Export individual lessons as standalone PDFs for focused study sessions.

### Quick Start for Contributors
1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:nvimbtw/Notes.git`
2. Install Typst: [Get it here](https://typst.app/).
3. Edit `.typ` files in your local copy (add content, fix math, etc.).
4. Compile: `typst compile ZP-1/ZP-1.typ` ‚Üí Outputs `ZP-1.pdf`.
5. Commit your changes and open a PR!

## Theme
The theme im using for this project is [Catppuccin Mocha](https://https://catppuccin.com/palette/). Its my personal favourite theme and I use it everywhere! If you wish to contribute, please keep this theme in mind.
